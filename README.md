In this course, you'll learn how to use Flutter to quickly develop high-quality, interactive mobile applications for iOS and Android devices. Whether you’re just getting started with mobile app development, or experienced with other mobile app frameworks, you’ll enjoy the high-velocity development and quality apps that Flutter enables.

Work with Google instructors step-by-step to build an app in one codebase that compiles down to native ARM code and has high performance on both iOS and Android. Learn how to develop fast by making use of Flutter's reactive framework, stateful Hot Reload, and integrated tooling. Customize your app with rich, composable widgets, built-in animations, and a layered, extensible architecture.
